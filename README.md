# ERA-CoT: Improving Chain-of-Thought through Entity Relationship Analysis

This is the codebase of the paper: ERA-CoT: Improving Chain-of-Thought through Entity Relationship Analysis.

![Framework of ERA-CoT](era-cot.png)

ERA-CoT performs entity extraction on text and finds out all the explicit relationships mentioned in the text, gradually infers the possible implicit relationships involved between entities based on the explicit relationships, then scores and filters the reliability of these implicit relationships, and finally answers questions based on these entity relationships. 

**We will release the code and instructions soon.**
