# ERA-CoT: Improving Chain-of-Thought through Entity Relationship Analysis

This is the codebase of the paper: [ERA-CoT: Improving Chain-of-Thought through Entity Relationship Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06932).

![Framework of ERA-CoT](era-cot.png)


ðŸ”¥ We are releasing the version 1.0 for running on Llama2 model.

## How to Use

Update your environment for the required dependency. 

```shell
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

Get your Llama2 weight on https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf/tree/main, set up on default directory: /root/llama-2-7b-chat-hf (You can change the dir on era-cot/config.py)

Running the code:

```shell
python main.py --dataset gsm8k \
--engine llama2-7b \
--temperature 0.3
```

## Different Dataset Results

ERA-CoT performs 
âœ…entity extraction on text and finds out all the explicit relationships mentioned in the text
âœ…gradually infers the possible implicit relationships involved between entities based on the explicit relationships
âœ…scores and filters the reliability of these implicit relationships
âœ…finally answers questions based on these entity relationships.
