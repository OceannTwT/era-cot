# ERA-CoT: Improving Chain-of-Thought through Entity Relationship Analysis

This is the codebase of the paper: [ERA-CoT: Improving Chain-of-Thought through Entity Relationship Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06932).

![Framework of ERA-CoT](era-cot.png)


🔥 We are releasing the version 1.0 for running on Llama2 model.

## How to Use

Update your environment for the required dependency. 

```shell
pip install -r requirement.txt
```

Get your Llama2 weight on https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf/tree/main, set up on default directory: /root/llama-2-7b-chat-hf (You can change the dir on era-cot/config.py)

Running the code:

```shell
python main.py --dataset gsm8k \
--engine llama2-7b \
--temperature 0.3
```

## Different Dataset Results

ERA-CoT performs 
✅entity extraction on text and finds out all the explicit relationships mentioned in the text
✅gradually infers the possible implicit relationships involved between entities based on the explicit relationships
✅scores and filters the reliability of these implicit relationships
✅finally answers questions based on these entity relationships.
